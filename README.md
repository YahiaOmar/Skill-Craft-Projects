# SkillCraft Projects

## Overview

Welcome to the **SkillCraft Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of data science and machine learning projects aimed at exploring and analyzing various datasets. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to machine learning modeling and clustering.

## Projects

### 1. Premier League EDA, Regression, and Clustering

This project involves analyzing Premier League data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), regression modeling, and clustering techniques. The goal is to uncover insights into player performance and team dynamics.

- **EDA**: Data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand data patterns and trends.
- **Regression**: Building and evaluating regression models to predict performance metrics.
- **Clustering**: Applying clustering algorithms to group players or teams based on performance metrics and interpreting the results.

### 2. Bank Marketing Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features from a bank marketing dataset. It involves a machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, and model evaluation.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Encoding, one-hot encoding, and scaling of features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting the top features using mutual information.
- **Model Building**: Training and evaluating an XGBoost classifier with cross-validation.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Using SMOTE to address class imbalance.
