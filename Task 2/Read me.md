# Premier League EDA, Regression, and Clustering

## Overview

This project explores and analyzes Premier League data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), regression modeling, and clustering techniques. The goal is to uncover insights, patterns, and relationships within the data to understand player performance and team dynamics better.

## Project Details

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yahiaomar/premier-league-eda-regression-and-clustring) and includes various metrics related to Premier League matches, teams, and players.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships between variables.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performing statistical tests to derive insights from the data.

### Regression Analysis

- **Feature Selection**: Identifying and selecting relevant features for regression modeling.
- **Model Building**: Constructing and evaluating regression models to predict player or team performance metrics.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., R-squared, Mean Squared Error).

### Clustering Analysis

- **Feature Engineering**: Preparing features for clustering algorithms.
- **Clustering Techniques**: Applying clustering methods (e.g., K-Means) to group players or teams based on performance metrics.
- **Cluster Interpretation**: Analyzing and interpreting the results of clustering to derive meaningful insights.
